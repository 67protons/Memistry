# Memistry
Game Technologies (ICS 62) Class Project

Memistry is a game I worked on in my 2014 Freshman class, ICS 62 "Game Technologies and Interactive Media" taught by profesor Dan Frost at UC Irvine.  I worked with two other classmates: Caitlin Nebril De Moss and Ian Tokuyama.

The game was created in Unity3D ver. 4 with models created in Blender by Caitlin and Ian and scripts written in C# by me.

Memistry was my first dive into 3D game engines and scripting for Unity, so most of my code is based off a Unity FPS scripting tutorial I watched on YouTube over the course of the project.

Later in the project, however, once I became more comfortable coding in C# (which was a large leap from Python), I was able to tweak parts of the code to better suit our individual game, straying away from the generic FPS the tutorial taught me to create.  

Namely, I implemented level advancement and the randomisation of spawning to different levels so that level ordering is different each time playing the game. I also implemented a sucessful main menu GUI shortly before the project was due.


CONTROLS:
The game has an instructions page on the main menu that describes how to play the game.
Basic FPS controls are used (WASD and mouse input), along with the R, P, and N buttons.
While there is a quit button on the main menu, there is no pause menu within the game unfortunately. The only way to quit is to hit Alt+F4, or complete the game and hit Esc on the win screen.
